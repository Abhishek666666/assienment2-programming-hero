        <h1>The most prestigious tournament in the world.
            Taking place quadrennially, the FIFA Men's World Cup™ sees 32 nations compete against each other for the
            prize. With continental qualification pathways leading to an exciting finals event, it brings fans together
            around the passion and love for the game.</h1>
        <h3>Will 2022 FIFA World Cup be held?
            Lusail is the biggest of the eight stadiums built or refurbished for the World Cup and will host the final
            on December 18. The first official match at the Lusail stadium that is to host this year's World Cup final
            will be held next month, Qatar's national federation said Tuesday.</h3>
        <h3>Will the World Cup be in 2022 or 2023?
            From next year's game, EA will use the EA Sports FC title instead, ending a run of almost 30 years of
            EA-made FIFA games. EA confirmed FIFA 23 includes World Cup Qatar 2022, which kicks off this November, and
            the Women's World Cup Australia and New Zealand 2023, which starts in July 2023.</h3>
        <h3>Where is the 2022 FIFA World Cup?
            Qatar is scheduled to host FIFA World Cup 2022™. It will be the first World Cup held in the Middle East and
            just the second to be staged in Asia.</h3>
